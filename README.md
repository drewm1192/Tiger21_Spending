# Tiger21_Spending
This small shiny application showcases a D3 node visualization that illustrates how the wealthiest individuals spend their money.

The live version of this visual can be found here: https://drewm1192.shinyapps.io/tiger21_spending/

Full files to this project are to come. Data visualzation was adapted from a tutorial provided by Nathan Yau from Flowing Data.
